Copy this template to start a new Shiny

Different Inputs, a tab-structure and two kinds of plots are presented
adjust those parameters in the way needed

do not change colors or expressions of the general shiny-aspects
do not change the stylesheet (style.css) unless you are very certain about it


Content of Files:

Open the 'Template.Rproj' to work in the correct directory

run.R - run the app (actually not necessary to modify)

helpers.R - load packages and store functions you coded for better structured code
	  - is called by server.R and ui.R

ui.R - build up the user interface

server.R - define the needed computational operations, mostly attached to output$...

www-folder - necessary for images and alike 
	    (do not change name of the folder!;
	    no need to specify any path for images [e.g. "my_image.png" instead of "www/my_image.png"])



Shinys are fun!
